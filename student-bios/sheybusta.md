## Hi there, my name is Sheyla

---

I was born in Per√∫ and grew up in Spain. I graduated with a bachelor in Journalism and Master degree in E-commerce from the University Complutense of Madrid. I'm slightly obsessed with photography, sustainability and **coding**. My mission is to find a new professional path within the UX-UI design field. I'm glad and excited to start my adventure with [HackYourFuture Belgium](https://www.hackyourfuture.net) family.

#### My favourite hobbies are:

Travelling :earth_america::green_heart::beetle:
Eating asian food.
Taking pictures.
Yoga and pilates.
