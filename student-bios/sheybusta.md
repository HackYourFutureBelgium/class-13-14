### Hi there, my name is Sheyla

---

I was born in Per√∫ and raised half of my life in Spain. I graduated with a bachelor in Journalism and Master degree in E-commerce from the University Complutense of Madrid. I'm slightly obsessed with photography, sustainability and **coding**. My mission is to find a new professional path into the UX-UI design world. I'm glad and excited to start my adventure with [HackYourFuture Belgium](https://www.hackyourfuture.net) family.

#### I love to:
